Based on the previous exploration, we identified that the largest number of products is described in the first 5 categories, taking the first as the parent category and 4 subsequent subcategories.
Given this approach, we proceed to filter the base data to develop the final dataframe for preprocessing and generate the training dataframes.
Finally, we identify that there are records of categories that have a frequency of less than 10, we store them in a new category that we will call 'other'.
